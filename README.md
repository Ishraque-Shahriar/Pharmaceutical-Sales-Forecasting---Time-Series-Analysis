# Pharmaceutical-Sales-Forecasting---Time-Series-Analysis
This repository contains the Pharmaceutical Sales Forecasting project, which uses time series analysis techniques to predict sales trends for a specific drug category (M01AB).


# Project Overview
This project aims to forecast monthly pharmaceutical sales using historical transactional data from a pharmacy's Point-of-Sale system. The dataset spans six years (2014-2019) and focuses on drugs under the M01AB category (Anti-inflammatory and Antirheumatic products). The objective is to develop a predictive model to optimize inventory management, reduce wastage, and enhance decision-making.

# Dataset Source
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle:
üîó Pharma Sales Data - Kaggle

# Methodology
The project follows a structured time series forecasting approach consisting of the following steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset and converted relevant columns to appropriate data types.
Handled missing data using imputation techniques.
Partitioned the dataset into training (2014-2018) and validation (2019) sets.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualized trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns in the sales data.
Identified seasonal peaks (higher sales in winter months).
Performed autocorrelation analysis to detect statistical dependencies.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Forecasting Models
Several forecasting models were implemented and evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):

Linear Regression with Trend and Seasonality + Moving Average for Residuals
üèÜ Best-performing model (RMSE: 9.803, MAPE: 5.403)
Linear Regression with Trend and Seasonality + AR(1) Model for Residuals
Seasonal ARIMA (1,1,1)(1,1,1)
Auto ARIMA
4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
The best model was identified as the Two-Level Model using:
Linear Regression for trend and seasonality
Moving Average for residuals
Forecasts were generated for future 12 months.

# How to Use the Code
Install Required Packages
Run the following command in R to install necessary libraries:

install.packages(c("dplyr", "readr", "forecast", "zoo"))

Run the R Script

Load the dataset (salesmonthly.csv).
Execute the Time Series Analytics_Pharmaceutical-Sales-Forecasting.R script.
Adjust file paths as needed.
Interpret Results

Check forecast accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAPE).
Visualize sales trends and predictions.


# Key Findings
Sales exhibit strong seasonality, peaking in winter and declining in summer.
Two-level regression models (with trend & seasonality adjustments) outperform traditional ARIMA methods.
Optimal forecasting models can significantly improve inventory management.
